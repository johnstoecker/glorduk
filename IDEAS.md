# Ideas

- health regen (Halo style)
- health pickups
- limited ammo
- play as a melee character instead of archer (or swap weapons)
- warning indicator when spawner is about to spawn (or countdown?).
  - specifically, thought it would be cool if it flashed red before a buffed enemy (like `fast_skeleton`) spawned
- more interesting arena
  - overall layout
  - some focus areas, e.g. player base and enemy base(s)
  - differentiation in wall types -- some block arrows, some can fire across
- destroyable buildings
- get resources (gold, lumber, oil) to buy things
- show player their kills + razings
- fog of war.
  - most of map is unexplored (black) at first.
